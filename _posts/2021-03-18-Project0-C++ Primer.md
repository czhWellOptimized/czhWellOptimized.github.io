Lecture #01: Course Introduction and the Relational Model

data model：A schema is a blueprint of the database which specifies what fields will be present and what would be their types. For example an `employee` table will have an `employee_ID` column represented by a string of 10 digits and an `employee_Name` column with a string of 45 characters. 

schema：Data model is a high level design which decides what can be present in the schema. It provides a database user with a conceptual framework in which we specify the database requirements of the database user and the structure of the database to fulfill these requirements.

A data model can, for example, be a relational model where the data will be organised in tables whereas the schema for this model would be the set of attributes and their corresponding domains.
