## Basics



## leader election(Section 5.2)

### how to start an election?

If a follower doesn't receive communication over the election timeout, it begins an election. 

The follower increments its current term and transitions to candidate state. It votes for itself and issues RequestVote RPCs to other servers in the cluster. A candidate continues in this state until one of three things happens: (a) it wins the election, (b) another server establishes itself as leader, or (c) a period of time goes by with no winner. 

Once a candidate wins an election, it becomes leader. It then sends heartbeat messages to all of the other servers to establish its authority and prevent new elections. 

###  The RequestVote RPC implements this restriction: 

the RPC includes information about the candidate’s log, and the voter denies its vote if its own log is more up-to-date than that of the candidate. 

### while waiting for votes, if a candidate receive an AppendEntries RPC from another server claiming to be leader, what does it do?

 If the leader’s term (included in its RPC) is at least as large as the candidate’s current term, then the candidate recognizes the leader as legitimate and returns to follower state. 

If the term in the RPC is smaller than the candidate’s current term, then the candidate rejects the RPC and continues in candidate state. 

### How to avoid the case that no candidate obtains a majority because of many followers become candidates at the same time and votes could be split?

 Raft uses randomized election timeouts to ensure that split votes are rare and that they are resolved quickly.

## log replication (Section 5.3)

### How to judge a log entry is committed?

 A log entry is committed once the leader that created the entry has replicated it on a majority of the servers (e.g., entry 7 in Figure 6). This also commits all preceding entries in the leader’s log, including entries created by previous leaders. 

### When does follower refuses the new entries from the leader?

 When sending an AppendEntries RPC, the leader includes the index and term of the entry in its log that immediately precedes the new entries. If the follower does not find an entry in its log with the same index and term, then it refuses the new entries. 

### Here are two conclusions in Log Matching Property:

If two entries in different logs have the same index and term, then they store the same command. 

If two entries in different logs have the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all preceding entries. 

We can draw a conclusion that if two entries in different logs have the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all preceding entries. Just use an induction step: from empty...... As a result, whenever AppendEntries returns successfully, the leader knows that the follower’s log is identical to its own log up through the new entries. 

### How to force the followers' logs to duplicate the leader's log?

 After a rejection, the leader decrements nextIndex and retries the AppendEntries RPC. Eventually nextIndex will reach a point where the leader and follower logs match. 

## safety(Section 5.2,5.4) 

### There is an election restriction:

 Raft uses the voting process to prevent a candidate from winning an election unless its log contains all committed entries.  

### how to determines which of two logs is more up-to-date?

- If the logs have last entries with different terms, then the log with the later term is more up-to-date. 
- If the logs end with the same term, then whichever log is longer is more up-to-date. 

  However, a leader cannot immediately conclude that an entry from a previous term is committed once it is stored on a majority of servers. 

To eliminate problems like the one in Figure 8, Raft never commits log entries from previous terms by counting replicas. Only log entries from the leader’s current term are committed by counting replicas.

但是我还没有明白  S1 怎么做到先commit4，顺带commit2











坑1：接受心跳包，从Follower到Follower，voteFor是要变-1的，然后if判断跳过了这个过程。。。吐血，debug了一天

```go
func (rf *Raft) convertTo(state int) {
	if rf.state == state {
		return
	}

	// fmt.Printf("Term:%d    %d    %s -> %s\n", rf.currentTerm, rf.me, C[rf.state], C[state])
	rf.state = state

	switch rf.state {
	case Follower:
		rf.electionTimer.Reset(randTimeDuration(MinElection, MaxElection))
		rf.heartbeatTimer.Stop()
		rf.votedFor = -1
	case Candidate:

		rf.startElection()
	case Leader:
		for i := range rf.nextIndex {
			rf.nextIndex[i] = len(rf.log)
		}
		for i := range rf.matchIndex {
			rf.matchIndex[i] = 0
		}
		rf.electionTimer.Stop()
		rf.broadcastHeartbeat()
		rf.heartbeatTimer.Reset(HeartbeatInterval)
	}
}
```

坑3：TestBackup2B中2，3分队。3中的other到2中后。最后这个other作为leader总是多commit一次。最后发现是心跳包设置时间长了的原因，只要把心跳包设置短一点即可（后面发现是坑4中的原因，和心跳包设置时间关系不大）

坑4：AppendEntries的时候Term相等需要格外注意，因为先前Election投票的时候Follower Term已经变为最新的Term了，后续接收心跳包时如果Term相等还是需要重置计时器。

犯错：heartbeat居然写成了下面这种。。。

```
if len(rf.log) < args.PreLogIndex+1 || (args.PreLogIndex >= 0 && rf.log[args.PreLogIndex].Term != args.Term) { //preLog unmatch
```

figure8 unreliable 出错

犯错：race condition，entries在进行RPC发送后，

```
			reply := AppendEntriesArgsReply{}
			if rf.sendAppendEntries(server, &args, &reply) {
				rf.mu.Lock()	
```

```go
	if umatchIdx != -1 { //need to append any new entries not already in the log
		if len(rf.log) < args.PreLogIndex+1+umatchIdx+1 {
			rf.log = append(rf.log, args.Entries[umatchIdx:]...)
		} else {
			rf.log = rf.log[:args.PreLogIndex+1+umatchIdx]
			rf.log = append(rf.log, args.Entries[umatchIdx:]...)
		}
	}
```

犯错（好像不是这个原因，待考证）：Start完事了以后要直接广播发心跳包，否则可能其他Follower要选举了

思考：在网上看到别的作者在appendEntries时还比较了PreIndex之后的长度，担心延迟，之前的短更新包。但仔细想想，是这样的么？如果自己的长，那么显然进入了更高的Term，直接会拒绝。对面也会因为接受到Reply时Term或者state不对而忽略应答包，那么这么问题就不存在了。

这可能是个问题： 在 Leader 收到 AppendEntries 的 Reply 时，需要先判断 term，然后再判断状态是否变了，即下面两个 if 语句顺序不能换。否则可能由于某种原因，该 Peer 状态变了（即不再是 Leader 或者 term 发生了更改），就直接返回了， 但有可能其更改后 Term 仍然比 reply.Term 小，从而没有及时变成 Follower。
